# 4-bit-Arithmetic-Logical-Unit
A parameterized 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit designed in Verilog HDL with comprehensive verification testbench. This ALU supports 8 fundamental operations with flag generation for status monitoring.
- 8 Arithmetic & Logic Operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Shift Left, Shift Right
- Flag Generation: Zero flag, Carry flag, Overflow flag
- Parameterized Design: Configurable bit-width (default 4-bit)
- Combinational Architecture: Single-cycle operation execution
- Exhaustive Verification: 100% functional coverage through systematic testbench
- Resource Efficient: Minimal gate count, optimized for area
